# YourParkingSpace iOS Technical Task

We would like you to develop a small app in Swift that lets users search for a movie using [The Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com) and display some core information about it.

We would like you to use SwiftUI to complete this task.

Some things to consider:
* Multiple Results
* Error Handling
* Unit Tests
* Handling offline situations gracefully

As a guideline the task should take around 3 hours to complete.

Please create a git repository and commit your code as you work on it.

Once you are done, invite @dsmailes and @AndyPepper to your repo.
